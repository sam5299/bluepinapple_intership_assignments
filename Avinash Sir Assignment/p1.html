      <p>
        The four llamas and two camels are Camelids tend to be large and
        strictly herbivours. Camelids differ from ruminants in serveral ways.
        They have a three-chambered rather than four-chambered digestive tract;
        an upper lip that is split in two with each part seperately mobile; and
        an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because
        they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body look longer
        still. (from Wikipedia)
